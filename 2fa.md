## Google Account 2FA

### Background
Google offers multiple options for 2-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance the security of your Google accounts. Here are some of the available options:

    Google Authenticator App: This is a mobile app available for both Android and iOS devices. It generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) that you use along with your password to log in to your Google account.

    Google Prompt: With this option, you receive a notification on your registered mobile device asking if you're trying to sign in. You can simply tap "Yes" to authenticate the login attempt.

    Security Key: You can use a physical security key, such as a USB or Bluetooth device, to verify your identity. This method provides strong protection against phishing and other types of attacks.

    Backup Codes: Google allows you to generate backup codes that you can use if you don't have access to your primary authentication method. These codes are meant to be stored securely and used as a last resort.

    SMS Verification: You can choose to receive a verification code via SMS when logging in. This method is less secure compared to others due to the potential for SIM swapping or interception of text messages.

    Google Smart Lock: This option allows you to use your Android device or Chromebook as a trusted device for seamless authentication without the need for manual codes.

### IRL
For numerous users, TOTPs emerge as the most self-reliant approach to adopt. It obviates the need for additional installations or integrations with Google. However, an issue arises in certain policies wherein the activation of TOTPs mandates prior utilization of one of the less desirable alternatives.

### Bypass
You can go with Google Prompt which just requires logging to your Google account from another device. After then, you will able to fetch the TOTP details.
Subsequently, you can remove the device from the list of authorized devices, thereby establishing TOTP as the primary 2FA method.
